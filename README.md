# weather-controller-vue

### The project simulates the controller of the weather and home conditions

## Is the project finished?

No, it isn't. 
At the moment there has been implemented:
- general view of the application. It should look great also on the mobile.
- log in/log out functionality. But it has been created only partly because there is no API to authenticate the user. 
- home page with buttons moving to area we want to control like outside the home or inside.
- tabs to observe the values of the temperature and pressure outside (simulated with random data).
- tab to configure temperature ramp.

Still whole inside area has to be created and also the ramp control tab and some another tabs like toget the rain data.

## What it has been created for?

It has been created as an anonimisation of my engineer thesis. 
That's why some functionalities like heating swimmingpool by temperature ramp can look crazy.
