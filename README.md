# weather-controller-vue

### The project simulates the controller of the weather and home conditions

## What technologies has been used?

- Vue.js - version 2
- Bootstrap Vue
- Highcharts
- Vuex
- Router Vue
- Moment Vue
- Notification Vue
- Sass

## What it has been created for?

It has been created as an anonimisation of my engineer thesis. 
That's why some functionalities like heating swimmingpool by temperature ramp can look crazy.

## How to run the app?

1. At first install Node.js and add it to your environmental variables.
2. Then in project directory run 'npm install'.
3. After packages instalation run in the same terminal 'npm run serve'.

Now the app should be running on your localhost. 
4. Open localhost in your browser on the port indicated in terminal (probably it is 8080).

## Description

-Will be added in the future-


## Is the project finished?

No, it isn't. 
At the moment there has been implemented:
- general view of the application. It should look great also on the mobile.
- log in/log out functionality. But it has been created only partly because there is no API to authenticate the user. 
- home page with buttons moving to area we want to control like outside the home or inside.
- tabs to observe the values of the temperature and pressure outside (simulated with random data).
- tab to configure temperature ramp.

Still whole inside area, the ramp control tab and some another tabs has to be created.
